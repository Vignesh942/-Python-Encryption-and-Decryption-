# Overview  
This Python script provides a simple yet secure way to **encrypt and decrypt messages** using the `cryptography.fernet` module. It employs **symmetric encryption**, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.  

## Features  

🔹 Key Generation   - Securely generates an encryption key using Fernet.generate_key().
🔹 Message Encryption - Encrypts a user-provided message for secure storage or transmission.
🔹 Message Decryption - Decrypts the encrypted message when the correct key is provided.


## How It Works  

1️⃣ Key Generation - A random encryption key is generated using Fernet.generate_key().
2️⃣ Encryption     - The user inputs a message, which is then encrypted using the generated key.
3️⃣ Decryption     - The user enters the key to decrypt the message. If the key matches, the message is successfully decrypted.
